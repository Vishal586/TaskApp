# TaskApp

This repository is designed to implement the essential features of a modern, full-stack web application. It serves as a practical foundation for developers looking to a project with a secure, scalable, and feature-rich architecture.

The primary focus is a dynamic React.js frontend with a responsive design using TailwindCSS. It includes secure forms with both client and server-side validation, along with protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access sensitive areas like the dashboard.

âœ… **Key Features**:-

Frontend (Primary Focus):-
Modern Framework: Built with React.js or Next.js.

Responsive UI: Crafted with TailwindCSS, Material UI, or Bootstrap.

Secure Forms: Robust validation on both client and server.

Protected Routes: JWT-based access control for private pages.

Backend (Supportive):-
Lightweight API: Built with Node.js/Express or Python (FastAPI/Django).
Authentication: Secure user signup and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Database Integration: Connects seamlessly with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.
Full CRUD: Complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete APIs for a sample data model (e.g., tasks, posts).

Dashboard & Security:-
User Management: Fetch and update user profiles.
Data Interaction: A full-featured UI for CRUD operations, including search and filter functionality.
Secure Practices: Strong bcrypt password hashing, JWT authentication middleware, and comprehensive error handling.
